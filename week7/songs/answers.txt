I would query the database to average the return value of the averages of the songs' energy, valence and danceability using:

SELECT ((avg_energy + avg_valence + avg_dance) / 3) as overall_average
FROM (
    SELECT
        AVG(energy) as avg_energy,
        AVG(valence) as avg_valence,
        AVG(danceability) as avg_dance
    From songs
);

The overall_average value returned for this user is 0.619987666666667.
I'd create an algorithm that rounds this return value then compares it to a list of possible 'moods' in the form of floats such as:

1.0 = spiritual
0.9 = ecstatic
0.8 = joyful
0.7 = content
0.6 = somewhat content
0.5 = indifferent

etc...

This may not be representative of the listener because it does not consider users who are 'hardcore' fans of one particular genre
whose songs tend to have high energy values, such as heavy metal, or lower energy values such as blues.

One way to resolve this would be to have the program average the energy, danceability and valence of all the songs in each genre.
The average values for each would be mapped to the midpoint of the scale above.
