            <p>Biplanes are unique, fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked above each other. These played a pivotal role in the early history of aviation. Originating in the late 19th century, biplanes were crucial in the developmental of future aircraft designs.</p>
            <p>Initially, these aircraft featured open cockpits and wooden frames, with fabric-covered wings. Over time, technological advancements led to the development and use of more powerful engines, more aerodynamic structures, and improved materials. Biplanes had a number of different uses, including military reconnaissance and early commercial flight.</p>
            <p>As technology progressed, monoplanes eventually surpassed biplanes in popularity due to their enhanced aerodynamics and efficiency. Biplanes, however, endure as a crucial forerunner in the evolution of aviation, marking a dynamic period of experimentation and innovation.</p>
